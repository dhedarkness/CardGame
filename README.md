A Menu Driven Card Game(High or Low)
Guess if the next card is gonna be higher or lower than this card. 
You get a wild card when Ace is the next card or the current card,because Ace is considered both as 1 and as 14 and you,
the player gets the benefit of the doubt. You also get benefit of doubt if the current card is equal to the previous one.
